# Mining-Quality-Prediction-Using-Machine-Deep-Learning-Coursera-Guided-Project


#### In this hands on project,I have trained machine learning and deep learning models to predict the % of silica concentrate in the iron ore concentrate per miniute.
#### This project could be practically used in mining industry to get the % silica concentrate at much faster rate compared to traditional one.
